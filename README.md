# InfoSec-Glossary
In InfoSec there are numerous terms where not only it's important to know their meaning but their acronym as well. I can tell you that I have witnessed this already in my early career! From conversations involving troubleshooting an issue with fellow coworkers across different teams, trialing out a product and speaking with a support rep, and reading documentation of a product or service, you should be comfortable with MOST of these common terms you're likely to come across.
