# InfoSec-Glossary
In InfoSec there are numerous terms where not only it's important to know their meaning but their acronym as well. I can tell you that I have witnessed this already in my early career! From conversations involving troubleshooting an issue with fellow coworkers across different teams, trialing out a product and speaking with a support rep, and reading documentation of a product or service, you should be comfortable with MOST of these common terms you're likely to come across. I created this glossary so that everyone can become comfortable with the definitions of most of these terms, and also conveniently assemble those definitions all into a single location. This glossary was created using both NIST's CSRC, and SANS glossaries as a guide.

<br></br>
Access Control List (ACL) - A mechanism that implements access control for a system resource by listing the identities of the system entities that are permitted to access the resource.<br></br>
Access Control Service - A security service that provides protection of system resources against unauthorized access. The two basic mechanisms for implementing this service are ACLs and tickets.<br></br>
Access Management - Access Management is the set of practices that enables only those permitted the ability to perform an action on a particular resource. The three most common Access Management services you encounter every day perhaps without realizing it are: Policy Administration, Authentication, and Authorization.<br></br>
Access Management Access - Management is the maintenance of access information which consists of four tasks: account administration, maintenance, monitoring, and revocation.<br></br>
Access Control Matrix - A table in which each row represents a subject, each column represents an object, and each entry is the set of access rights for that subject to that object.<br></br>

Chain of Evidence - A process and record that shows who obtained the evidence; where and when the evidence was obtained; who secured the evidence; and who had control or possession of the evidence. The “sequencing” of the chain of evidence follows this order: collection and identification; analysis; storage; preservation; presentation in court; return to owner. Rationale: Sufficiently covered under chain of custody.<br></br>
Chain of Trust CoT - A certain level of trust in supply chain interactions such that each participant in the consumer-provider relationship provides adequate protection for its component products, systems, and services.<br></br>
Certificate Revocation List (CRL) - These are digitally signed “blacklists” of revoked certificates. Certification authorities (CAs) periodically issue certificate revocation lists (CRLs), and users can retrieve them on demand via repositories.<br></br>
Certificate Status Authority (CSA) - A trusted entity that provides on-line verification to a relying party of a subject certificate's trustworthiness, and may also provide additional attribute information for the subject certificate.<br></br>

Capability List - A list attached to a subject ID specifying what accesses are allowed to the subject.<br></br>
Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) Mode - A cryptographic technique in which the same plaintext block if repeated, produces different ciphertext blocks. In this scheme, the input to the encryption algorithm is the XOR of the current plaintext block and the preceding ciphertext block; the same key is used for each block. In effect, we have chained together the processing of the sequence of plaintext blocks.<br></br>

Criticality - A measure of the degree to which an organization depends on the information or information system for the success of a mission or of a business function.<br></br>
Criticality Analysis - An end-to-end functional decomposition performed by systems engineers to identify mission critical functions and components. Includes identification of system missions, decomposition into the functions to perform those missions, and traceability to the hardware, software, and firmware components that implement those functions. Criticality is assessed in terms of the impact of function or component failure on the ability of the component to complete the system missions(s).<br></br>
Criticality Level - Refers to the (consequences of) incorrect behavior of a system. The more serious the expected direct and indirect effects of incorrect behavior, the higher the criticality level.<br></br>
Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF) - A web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce users to perform actions that they do not intend to perform. It allows an attacker to partly circumvent the same origin policy, which is designed to prevent different websites from interfering with each other. For example, if a bank website is vulnerable to a CSRF attack, it may be possible for a subscriber to unintentionally authorize a large money transfer, merely by viewing a malicious link in a webmail message while a connection to the bank is open in another browser window.<br></br>
Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - A web security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious code into an otherwise benign website. These scripts acquire the permissions of scripts generated by the target website and can therefore compromise the confidentiality and integrity of data transfers between the website and client. Websites are vulnerable if they display user-supplied data from requests or forms without sanitizing the data so that it is not executable.<br></br>
Data Encryption Standard (DES) - A widely-used method of data encryption using a private (secret) key. There are 72,000,000,000,000,000 (72 quadrillion) or more possible encryption keys that can be used. For each given message, the key is chosen at random from among this enormous number of keys. Like other private key cryptographic methods, both the sender and the receiver must know and use the same private key.<br></br>
Data Loss Prevention (DLP) - A systems ability to identify, monitor, and protect data in use (e.g. endpoint actions), data in motion (e.g. network actions), and data at rest (e.g. data storage) through deep packet content inspection, contextual security analysis of transaction (attributes of originator, data object, medium, timing, recipient/destination, etc.), within a centralized management framework. Data loss prevention capabilities are designed to detect and prevent the unauthorized use and transmission of NSS information.<br></br>
Defense-in-Depth (DiD) - Information security strategy integrating people, technology, and operations capabilities to establish variable barriers across multiple layers and dimensions of the organization.<br></br>

Denial of Service (DoS) - The prevention of authorized access to resources or the delaying of time-critical operations.<br></br>
Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) - An asymmetric cryptographic algorithm that produces a digital signature in the form of a pair of large numbers. The signature is computed using rules and parameters such that the identity of the signer and the integrity of the signed data can be verified.<br></br>

Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) - A written plan for processing critical applications in the event of a major hardware or software failure or destruction of facilities.<br></br>
Discretionary Access Control (DAC) - An access control policy that is enforced over all subjects and objects in an information system where the policy specifies that a subject that has been granted access to information can do one or more of the following: (i) pass the information to other subjects or objects; (ii) grant its privileges to other subjects; (iii) change security attributes on subjects, objects, information systems, or system components; (iv) choose the security attributes to be associated with newly-created or revised objects; or (v) change the rules governing access control. Mandatory access controls restrict this capability.<br></br>
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) -  A denial of service technique that uses numerous hosts to perform the attack.<br></br>
DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) - An email security standard designed to make sure messages aren’t altered in transit between the sending and recipient servers. It uses public-key cryptography to sign email with a private key as it leaves a sending server. Recipient servers then use a public key published to a domain’s DNS to verify the source of the message, and that the body of the message hasn’t changed during transit. Once the signature is verified with the public key by the recipient server, the message passes DKIM and is considered authentic.<br></br>
Domain-based Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) - An email authentication, policy, and reporting protocol. It builds on the widely deployed SPF and DKIM protocols, adding linkage to the author (“From:”) domain name, published policies for recipient handling of authentication failures, and reporting from receivers to senders, to improve and monitor protection of the domain from fraudulent email.<br></br>
