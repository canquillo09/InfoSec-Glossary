# InfoSec-Glossary
In InfoSec there are numerous terms where not only it's important to know their meaning but their acronym as well. I can tell you that I have witnessed this already in my early career! From conversations involving troubleshooting an issue with fellow coworkers across different teams, trialing out a product and speaking with a support rep, and reading documentation of a product or service, you should be comfortable with MOST of these common terms you're likely to come across. I created this glossary so that everyone can become comfortable with the definitions of most of these terms, and also conveniently assemble those definitions all into a single location. This glossary was created using both NIST's CSRC, and SANS glossaries as a guide.

# A-B
Access Control - Access Control ensures that resources are only granted to those users who are entitled to them.
<br></br>
Access Control List (ACL) - A mechanism that implements access control for a system resource by listing the identities of the system entities that are permitted to access the resource.<br></br>
Access Control Service - A security service that provides protection of system resources against unauthorized access. The two basic mechanisms for implementing this service are ACLs and tickets.<br></br>
Access Management - Access Management is the set of practices that enables only those permitted the ability to perform an action on a particular resource. The three most common Access Management services you encounter every day perhaps without realizing it are: Policy Administration, Authentication, and Authorization.<br></br>
Access Management Access - Management is the maintenance of access information which consists of four tasks: account administration, maintenance, monitoring, and revocation.<br></br>
Access Control Matrix - A table in which each row represents a subject, each column represents an object, and each entry is the set of access rights for that subject to that object.<br></br>
Account Harvesting - Account Harvesting is the process of collecting all the legitimate account names on a system.<br></br>
ACK Piggybacking - ACK piggybacking is the practice of sending an ACK inside another packet going to the same destination.<br></br>
Active Content - Program code embedded in the contents of a web page. When the page is accessed by a web browser, the embedded code is automatically downloaded and executed on the user's workstation. Ex. Java, ActiveX (MS)<br></br>
Activity Monitors - Activity monitors aim to prevent virus infection by monitoring for malicious activity on a system, and blocking that activity when possible.<br></br>
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) - Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a protocol for mapping an Internet Protocol address to a physical machine address that is recognized in the local network. A table, usually called the ARP cache, is used to maintain a correlation between each MAC address and its corresponding IP address. ARP provides the protocol rules for making this correlation and providing address conversion in both directions.<br></br>
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) - A U.S. Government-approved cryptographic algorithm that can be used to protect electronic data. The AES algorithm is a symmetric block cipher that can encrypt (encipher) and decrypt (decipher) information.<br></br>
Algorithm - A finite set of step-by-step instructions for a problem-solving or computation procedure, especially one that can be implemented by a computer.<br></br>
Asymmetric Cryptography - Public-key cryptography; A modern branch of cryptography in which the algorithms employ a pair of keys (a public key and a private key) and use a different component of the pair for different steps of the algorithm.<br></br>
Auditing - Independent review and examination of records and activities to assess the adequacy of system controls, to ensure compliance with established policies and operational procedures.<br></br>
Authentication - Verifying the identity of a user, process, or device, often as a prerequisite to allowing access to resources in an information system.<br></br>
Authenticity - Authenticity is the validity and conformance of the original information.<br></br>
Authorization - The process of granting user or process the permission to do or have access to something.<br></br>
Autonomous System (AS) - One or more routers under a single administration operating the same routing policy.<br></br>
Availability - Ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of information.<br></br>
Backdoor - A backdoor is a tool installed after a compromise to give an attacker easier access to the compromised system around any security mechanisms that are in place.<br></br>
Banner - A banner is the information that is displayed to a remote user trying to connect to a service. This may include version information, system information, or a warning about authorized use.<br></br>
Bastion Host - A special purpose computer on a network where the computer is specifically designed and configured to withstand attacks.<br></br>
BIND - BIND stands for Berkeley Internet Name Domain and is an implementation of DNS. DNS is used for domain name to IP address resolution.<br></br>
Biometrics - Measurable physical characteristics or personal behavioral traits used to identify, or verify the claimed identity of, an individual. Facial images, fingerprints, and handwriting samples are all examples of biometrics.<br></br>
Block Cipher - An invertible symmetric-key cryptographic algorithm that operates on fixed-length blocks of input using a secret key and an unvarying transformation algorithm. The resulting output block is the same length as the input block.<br></br>
Blue Team - The group responsible for defending an enterpriseâ€™s use of information systems by maintaining its security posture against a group of mock attackers (i.e., the Red Team). Typically the Blue Team and its supporters must defend against real or simulated attacks 1) over a significant period of time, 2) in a representative operational context (e.g., as part of an operational exercise), and 3) according to rules established and monitored with the help of a neutral group refereeing the simulation or exercise (i.e., the White Team).<br></br>
